//   the invoice  read once, top to bottom: who and what, the amount and where
//                it stands, the dates, then its lines grouped by category
//   what's open  a line, with its receipts, stepping line by line; or, with
//                no line open, the invoice itself (the copy that was sent, or
//                the PDF preview for a draft) and the invoice's own documents
// Side by side on a wide screen; one at a time under 640px of container
// width, as a push navigation. Sales or Purchases is the "inbox" choice: a
// sub-bar selector wide, a level-0 chooser opened from the list's title
// when stacked. The top bar's search filters the list; a status menu narrows it.
//
// The list is index rows, windowed and fetched page by page where the reader
// is; only the invoice that is open is loaded as a document.
