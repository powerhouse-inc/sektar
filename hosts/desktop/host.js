// The desktop shape: a production switchboard next to the BUILT Connect,
// supervised by the desktop runner (@powerhousedao/desktop — run/serve are
// the generic compound; `dev` opens a native shell window; `build` stages
// the shippable stack). Run `ph run connect build` once, then
// `ph run desktop`. At `run`, each member uses its own default mode below;
// `ph run desktop <verb>` forwards uniformly. Members derive from the sibling
// hosts (full inclusion); the server member serves the switchboard host's
// drives, and the connect member attaches every drive the server reports
// (declared and plugin-created) as REMOTES, by `$map` over its outputs.
