/**
 * Keeps the identifier index in step with the collections.
 *
 * Rather than replay how identifiers move — capture, alias, merge, split all
 * shift them — this re-reads the affected document and rewrites its rows
 * wholesale. That is idempotent by construction, which matters because a
 * batch is not guaranteed to hold each document once: on a history replay it
 * holds one entry per past operation, and an index built by applying deltas
 * would count each of them.
 *
 * Resolution uses the model's own `liveSource`, exported from the document
 * model for exactly this reason. A read model that resolves merges by its
 * own rules is a read model that disagrees with the documents it describes.
