To know what a file says, read it with sektarReadAttachment: never guess from its name. The same file can sit on several documents; adding it to another copies nothing.",

For a line, add lineId: sektarListAttachments on the invoice gives the lines' ids. Attachments live on the invoice and on each line, and a void invoice takes none.",
